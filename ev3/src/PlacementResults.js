              Optimal EV Charging Infrastructure Placement

              Using trip data collected by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC),
              a simulation was conducted on a hypothetical scenario in the Atlanta
              Metropolitan area with 30,000 BEV users with baseline parameters such
              as risk sensitivity, preference towards faster charging, prices of
              charging and commercial electricity. This simulation yielded the
              following optimal placements of Level 2 and Direct Current Fast
              Charging chargers.

              These results show that under these assumptions, charging stations
              are not necessary in much higher numbers in areas with greater travel
              demands - the distribution is spread out somewhat evenly across most
              areas.

            <div>
              Under the optimal configuration found in our research, the
              average charging time was around 6.9 hours, with much shorter
              average charging times at work and in public and much longer
              average charging times at home.

              User charging preferences do not have a significant impact on the optimal
              number and ratio of Level 2 and DCFC chargers, but they do
              dramatically affect the optimal NPV generated by installing these
              charging stations.

              Public charging price, however, has a massive effect on charging
              station layouts and NPV. In general, the more expensive the price
              of charging, the number of charging stations in the optimal layout
              decreases and the NPV peaks at around $0.73/kWh and sharply
              decreases if perturbed.

              Unsurprisingly, the more BEV users there are in the market,
              the more charging stations will be required and the more valuable
              this infrastructure becomes.
